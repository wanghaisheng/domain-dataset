Acquiring a comprehensive dataset that specifically collects and catalogs product or service price plans associated with domains across various TLDs can be challenging. This type of dataset typically requires extensive data collection efforts from multiple sources, including e-commerce platforms, retailers, service providers, and domain registries. Here are some approaches and potential sources where you might find relevant datasets or data that could be used to build such a dataset:

1. **E-commerce Platforms**:
   - Large e-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and others often provide APIs or data feeds that include product pricing information. While these platforms may not categorize products by domain TLDs specifically, they offer extensive datasets that can be filtered and analyzed.

2. **Marketplace Data Providers**:
   - Companies that aggregate and provide access to e-commerce data, such as Nielsen, Euromonitor, or SimilarWeb, may offer datasets or APIs that include pricing information across different product categories.

3. **Domain Industry Reports**:
   - Market research firms focusing on the domain industry occasionally publish reports that include insights into pricing strategies for domain-based products or services. These reports may not provide raw datasets but can offer valuable insights.

4. **Web Scraping and Data Aggregation**:
   - Automated web scraping techniques can be employed to gather pricing information directly from e-commerce websites and domain-related platforms. However, this approach requires careful consideration of legal implications and adherence to terms of service.

5. **Custom Surveys and Research**:
   - Conducting custom surveys among e-commerce businesses, retailers, and service providers could gather targeted data on pricing strategies specific to domains and TLDs.

6. **Government and Regulatory Data**:
   - Some government agencies or regulatory bodies may collect data on e-commerce transactions and pricing strategies as part of their economic studies or consumer protection efforts.

7. **Academic Research Datasets**:
   - Academic researchers studying digital marketing, e-commerce, and related fields sometimes publish datasets related to online pricing and consumer behavior. These datasets may include indirect indicators relevant to domain-based pricing.

8. **Open Data Initiatives**:
   - Open data platforms or initiatives may occasionally host datasets related to e-commerce transactions or digital economy metrics, which could include relevant pricing information.

Given the complexity and diversity of data sources required to compile such a dataset, it may be necessary to integrate data from multiple providers and conduct thorough validation and normalization processes. Additionally, be mindful of data privacy regulations and terms of use when accessing and using third-party data sources.

While a centralized and comprehensive dataset focused specifically on product or service pricing behind domains across all TLDs may not exist, leveraging multiple sources and methodologies can help in gathering meaningful insights into online pricing strategies and trends.
